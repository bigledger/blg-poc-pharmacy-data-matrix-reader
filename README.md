# blg-poc-pharmacy-data-matrix-reader
A proof of concept app to scan pharmaceutical Data Matrix codes (FarmaTag), detect holograms, and parse GS1 AIs (GTIN, Expiry, Batch, Serial) on iOS.

## iOS wireless deploy (Xcode 15+)
Prereqs: enable Wireless Debugging (Pair via Wi‑Fi) in Xcode for your device.

```
cd iosApp
./deploy-wireless.sh <YOUR_DEVICE_UDID>
```
If you omit the UDID, the script uses a default and tries to auto-locate the built .app in DerivedData.

## Build directories: build vs build-output
- build: This is the Gradle working directory. It contains ephemeral compilation outputs, caches, intermediates, and per-task artifacts (for example, Compose Desktop binaries under build/compose/...). It is safe to delete at any time (gradlew clean does this). It should not be committed to git.
- build-output: This repository folder is for final, user-facing deliverables that we want to keep handy and potentially commit for sharing (e.g., DMG/MSI/ZIP generated by release builds). For example, the macOS DMG lives at build-output/Avelon Pharmacy Data Matrix Reader-1.0.0.dmg. Unlike build, this folder is not cleared by gradle clean and is meant to persist between builds.

Tip: The provided build scripts write their default outputs under build/compose/... (Gradle’s area). After a release, you can copy the installer(s) you want to share into build-output to keep a clean record.

## What it does
- Uses Apple Vision to scan Data Matrix (and QR as fallback)
- Parses GS1 AIs: 01 (GTIN), 17 (Expiry YYMMDD), 10 (Batch), 21 (Serial), 11 (Production Date)
- Adds Manufacturer Country derived from GTIN prefix (approximate)
- Runs hologram detection overlay while scanning

Launches the WorkingFarmaTagScannerView in the iOS app.
